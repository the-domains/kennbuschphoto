# About Me

I've been writing about and photographing buildings and places for 15 years. I specialize in detailed architectural interiors, materials and textures. I bring high quality equipment, lighting, a trained eye, and a professional, upbeat demeanor to all of my shoots. 

I can also help you find creative ways to get the most out of your professional photography through advertorials, CEU stories, promotional materials: web, press releases, and client/customer mailings.
Based in Madison, Wisconsin, I work on assignment across North America and Europe. Get in touch to discuss your photography and editorial needs!
